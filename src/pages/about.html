                    Arunachali
                    musical prince Taba Chake's music is the kind that will
                    make you stop
                    and listen, in a world that is forcing you to rush on. With his latest record 'Bombay Dreams', Chake
                    has
                    taken the
                    country by storm, captivating thousands of people through live performances, stacking up millions of
                    streams across
                    platforms, and garnering lakhs of monthly listeners in nearly a hundred countries. All this praise
                    and
                    adoration for
                    Chake's music is a testament to his ability to give us, especially in these times, music that is
                    authentic and
                    nostalgic, music that takes us back to our roots. His animated music video for 'Walk With Me', a
                    seemingly effortless
                    song about the realities of love and distance in our daily lives, earned him a million views, and we
                    watched on as he
                    was featured on Apple's website alongside Taylor Swift.
                    The Indian press was quick to take stock of what was happening. From The Hindu to Rolling Stone, The
                    Indian Music
                    Diaries to Indian Express, all had something to say about Chake's unique style: one that is so
                    relatable
                    -- with
                    simplicity at its core -- that it manages to connect with people from all around the world. "Truly,
                    music has no
                    boundaries,'' says Taba who proudly writes and performs in Nyishi, Hindi,  English and Assamese.
                    Platform Magazine
                    dubbed the record "A Love Letter to the City of Dreams", calling it an album “with a whimsical
                    dreaminess and a sense of
                    hope”. Without a doubt, Chake's music will remind you about what it means to be human: the true bond
                    with nature, the
                    genuineness of love and friendship and just the simplicity of it all. 
                    Grew up listening to Hindustani Classical, Rock, Math Rock, Pop,  Metal, Singer-Songwriter, Tribal
                    Folks, Traditional
                    Jazz, Reggae and Percussive Fingerstyle Guitar Players one can easily recognize by listening. In a
                    matter of a few
                    years, bringing accolades and recognition, Chake has managed to carve a loyal audience for himself
                    and
                    is now
                    establishing his mark in the mainstream as well. Already working towards new releases, music videos,
                    and
                    international
                    shows, it’s not hard to foresee Chake's ascent to stardom in the years to come. Needless to say,
                    fans,
                    critics and
                    fellow musicians are all waiting, and who wouldn't when, as Redbull Music says, "Taba Chake is one
                    of
                    those songwriters
                    whose music seems to always put you in a happy place.”
